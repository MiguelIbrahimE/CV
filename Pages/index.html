            <p>I am a Lebanese American undergraduate Computer Science student currently finishing
                my BS at the Lebanese American University. Since I enrolled in the program, I have
                remained an active student and worker at the university, where I worked as a Teacher's
                Assistant and volunteered in 2 major courses of Computer Science. I am passionate
                about technology and coding and understand their values in organizing our lives. I have
                great verbal and written communication skills in English (7/9 on IELTS - Academic) and
                Arabic, and currently learning Spanish.</p>
